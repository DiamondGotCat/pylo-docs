# Hello, World!
As with any programming language, let's start with...Hello, World!

## Write code
First, let's write code... Oh, I forgot to mention that.

Pylo doesn't require a project directory or anything, it can be executed directly.

So, once you write your script file, you can run it right away.

Try imitating the following:

### 1. Create new file `hello-world.pylo`
with This Content:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```

### 2. Run command
if You Installed Python-version:
```
python3 <Pylo's Path> hello-world.pylo
```

if You Installed Binary-version:
```
pylo hello-world.pylo
```

### 3. See the results
After a short wait, Pylo will print the text `Hello, World!` to your terminal.

Then it was a success!
