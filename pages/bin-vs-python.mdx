# Binary vs Python
Official binaries of Pylo are built using PyInstaller.

Pylo is written on top of Python, and such a tool was required to build it.

This page compares the ease of use, speed, etc. of running Python files directly vs. using the binary version.

## Binary
Pylo's binary version is a self-contained program, its performance tied to your system's kernel and architecture.

While it's slower to launch, once running, Pylo scripts execute dramatically faster than the Python version.

Choose the binary for optimal speed. However, its slow startup makes the Python version preferable for frequent launches, such as during development.

## Python
Let's examine the Python version.

Pylo's Python version boasts incredibly fast startup times, but processing speed lags afterward.

It's not ideal for performance-critical applications. However, its rapid startup is perfect for developers who frequently open and close the program.
