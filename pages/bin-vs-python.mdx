# Binary vs Python
Official Pylo binaries are built using PyInstaller.

This page compares the ease of use, speed, and performance of running Pylo as a binary versus executing the Python source code directly.

## Binary
Pylo's binary version is a self-contained executable, with performance optimized for your system's architecture and kernel.

While the startup time is slightly longer, Pylo scripts run significantly faster compared to the Python version.

Use the binary version for optimal runtime performance. However, if you frequently launch and close the program during development, the Python version may be more convenient.

## Python
The Python version of Pylo starts up very quickly but has lower execution performance once running.

Itâ€™s not ideal for performance-critical use cases, but its fast startup makes it an excellent choice for active development and debugging.
